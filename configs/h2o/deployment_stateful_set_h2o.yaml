# It is strongly recommended to run H2O as a Stateful set on a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes assumes 
# all the pods inside the cluster are stateful and does not attempt to restart the individual pods on 
# failure. Once a job is triggered on an H2O cluster, the cluster is locked and no additional nodes can 
# be added. Therefore, the cluster has to be restarted as a whole if required â€“ which is a perfect fit 
# for a StatefulSet.
